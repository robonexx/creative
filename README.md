# creative

This is my first solo project at KYH. And first solo upload at Github. 

Assignment was to build a website using HTML and CSS also a little javascript.

I did a page about creativity. Creative people are the ones who usually find solutions to problems. 
How do we become creative? what is the source for this spark?
Inspiration leads to imagination wich leads to creativity.
As kids we have wild imaginations that usually sparks our creative side.

I learned a lot during the process and will continue to work a bit on this

Hope you enjoy this first one on Github. 

PEACE / Rob-1
