# creative

This is my first solo project at KYH. And first solo upload at Github. 

Assignment was to build a website using HTML and CSS also a little javascript.

I did a page about creativity. Creative people are the ones who usually find solutions to problems. 
How do we become creative? what is the source for this spark?
Inspiration leads to imagination wich leads to creativity.
As kids we have wild imaginations that usually sparks our creative side.

My sources for inspiration has been as follows

Webbutveckling 1 2a upplagan (swedish book about webdevelopment)
Udemy course. Web developer bootcamp by Colt Steele.
Traversy media, Dev Ed and Fransk laboratory on Youtube. Awesome tutorials. 

I used some stuff that i learned and Some stuff from ex Fransk lab is way over my knowledge, but i flipped it a bit and used it
on this one. Its not a product for commercial use, only for study purposes. 

I learned a lot during the process and will continue to work a bit on this, the hamburger menu is a bit too far to the side
the pictures was only for the assignment, will change the content. 

Hope you enjoy this first one on Github. 

PEACE / Rob-1
